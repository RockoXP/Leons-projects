                                    <h3>I'm Leonardo Leitao a <span>Junior Data Scientist</span></h3>
                                    <p>I am Leonardo, a dedicated professional with a robust academic background and a passion for technology and data science. 
                                        I earned my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Kent in Canterbury, England, where I gained a
                                         comprehensive understanding of human biology, disease mechanisms, and laboratory diagnostics. 
                                         This program emphasized practical laboratory skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities, providing me with a 
                                         solid foundation in scientific research and analysis.
                                        Pursuing my interest in the intersection of biology and technology, I completed a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering 
                                        at Queen Mary University of London. During this time, I focused on technologically intensive courses such as Computational Fluid Dynamics 
                                        and Robotics, which deepened my understanding of complex biological systems and the technological innovations used to model and interact 
                                        with them. This experience was pivotal in igniting my passion for technology and its applications in solving real-world problems.
                                        After a year of exploration to identify my ideal career path, I enrolled in Le Wagon's Data Science & AI course. 
                                        This intensive program equipped me with advanced data skills, including data extraction, manipulation, and visualization using tools like 
                                        Python, SQL, and Jupyter. I mastered machine learning and deep learning techniques, enabling me to create predictive models and AI solutions. 
                                        The curriculum also covered deploying machine learning models into production, working collaboratively in data teams, and building a solid 
                                        portfolio of projects. 
                                        Fluent in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, I bring a collaborative and adaptable mindset to diverse teams. 
                                        My initiative and tenacity ensure I meet high standards, and my commitment to teamwork means I prioritize the best outcomes over personal credit. 
                                        I am particularly inspired by environments that combine technical expertise with a hands-on, entrepreneurial approach to creating value at 
                                        extraordinary rates.
                                        I am eager to leverage my analytical mindset, technical skills, and collaborative spirit in a dynamic and purpose-driven environment, 
                                        contributing to innovative projects and continuous growth.</p>

                                                        Biomedical Engineering at Queen Mary University of London. During this time, I focused on technologically intensive courses 
                                                        such as Computational Fluid Dynamics and Robotics, which deepened my understanding of complex biological systems and the

                                                        This project allowed for the enhancement of analytical and research abilities since I’ve faced a multitude of challenges going into this project, 
                                                        my knowledge of Computational fluid dynamic was rather poor, and the models created depicted that but through immeasurable amount of knowledge acquired 
                                                        by the vast amount of journal papers reviewed. 
                                                        Many problems occurred while taking on such project,  resilience was a key factor because these problems forced me to ask for help something that’s not

                                                        machine learning model project focused on forecasting house prices in various regions of Portugal. This hands-on experience encompassed the full data science pipeline,
                                                         from data gathering to deploying a user-friendly application.

                                                        Data Gathering and Preprocessing
                                                        As a team, we worked together to source relevant data, ensuring it provided sufficient coverage of key variables like location, property size, and pricing trends. 
                                                        Cleaning and processing this data was a meticulous process, involving the handling of missing values, the removal of duplicates, and applying feature engineering techniques
                                                         to enhance the dataset's predictive potential. My attention to detail and strong analytical skills were instrumental in identifying and addressing potential data quality issues.

                                                        We explored multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model for our task. Techniques such as linear regression, random forests, and gradient boosting 
                                                        were tested using cross-validation to ensure robust results. My contributions included not only helping evaluate the models but also interpreting the results to fine-tune the final

                                                        The backend of our project was developed in Python, leveraging powerful libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for modeling, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for exploratory data analysis.
                                                        For the frontend, we used Streamlit to create an intuitive and interactive web application, allowing users to input parameters and visualize predictions effortlessly.

                                                        Geospatial Map: I integrated a dynamic geospatial map that visualized house price distributions across Portugal, offering users insights into pricing patterns in specific regions.
                                                        Heatmap and Correlation Analysis: I added a heatmap and a correlation graph that demonstrated the relationship between location and property size, highlighting key factors influencing price trends.
                                                        Mortgage Calculator: To increase the app's practical utility, I implemented a mortgage calculator, enabling users to estimate monthly payments based on predicted house prices, interest rates, and loan terms.
                                                        Chatbot Integration: To further improve user experience, our team developed a chatbot that answered users' questions about the dataset, the prediction model, and property-related queries. This feature made 
                                                        the app more interactive and accessible.
                                                        
                                                        Key Takeaways
                                                        This project underscored the importance of teamwork and cross-disciplinary collaboration in delivering a comprehensive data product. I shined in bringing a strong analytical perspective and creative solutions,
                                                         contributing to both the technical and functional aspects of the application. 
                                                         By combining data science with user-centric design, we created a tool that was not only technically sound but also practical and engaging for users.
                                                        This experience solidified my passion for leveraging data and technology to solve real-world problems, further fueling my drive to innovate and contribute meaningfully in the tech space. </p>
